        <p>We are currently in a time when human demands on the Earthâ€™s resources surpass its resilience by a significant margin. Half
            of the global population resides in cities where our connection to nature is often unclear. Moving forward, human settlements
            must harmoniously blend into the natural world rather than stand as isolated entities in competition with it. This means urban
            and architectural design should incorporate flora and fauna as integral components alongside humans, taking into account
            their needs and roles within the urban environment. As the division between our built environments and the natural world
            blurs and shifts, architects must find new solutions to the physical boundary between us and the other residents of the earth.</p>
